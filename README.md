### Bundling assets into dist directory
Use gulp. By default you can run `gulp` to build everything, but you can run
```
gulp --tasks
```
to see other tasks, or peek at the gulpfile.

If you have any issues with gulp, check out this [article](https://gist.github.com/noraj/007a943dc781dc8dd3198a29205bae04).
