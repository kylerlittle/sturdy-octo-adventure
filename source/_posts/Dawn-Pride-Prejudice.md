## Piano Cover by Dario Marianelli
So I've been playing piano for just over a year & a half and decided to tackle this song because it's my wife's favorite piano song. This definitely is far from perfect (you'll notice 1 glaring error and several others if you know the song), but I'm happy because I achieved far more than I thought possible. I decided to put out a video with mistakes because YouTube is full of so many nearly perfect videos, and I think it's okay to not reach that! As long as you're enjoying what you're playing and finding meaning in it, that's all that matters. For me, I am currently going through Alfred's Adult All-in-One Piano Course (level 2), but I like to challenge myself with more difficult songs on the side to learn or practice new skills. For example, it was just 5 months ago that I was introduced to the sostenuto pedal, and this song is incredible practice with that! It also features polyrhythms and arpeggios, two things I had never tried before. It also features subtle dynamics. This is by far the hardest song I've attempted to learn, and I've been learning it for the last 2.5 months. Thankfully, the piece is in C Major and features few black keys, or else it probably would have been too difficult for me to even attempt. Anyways, I hope you enjoy!
