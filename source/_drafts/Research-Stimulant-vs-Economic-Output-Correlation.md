## Prompt
Is there a correlation between high stimulant drug usage and economic output in cities around the world today?

## Initial Thoughts
I've been reading Blitzed, a book about the proliferation of methamphetamine (commonly referred to as "meth") in the Third Reich, and the image of Nazis storming across Europe hopped up on meth was quite a different historical narrative than the one I learned in high school. It's brought a new meaning to how the Nazis were able to accomplish their infamous blitzkrieg - "lightning warfare." As I was thinking about this extreme usage of drugs, I pondered how high stimulant drugs, like meth, impact society today. While obviously the use of drugs in warfare is an extreme case of how to effectively use high stimulant drugs, I was curious - do drugs like coffee or illegal drugs like cocaine work similarly? While it's difficult to analyze whether these drugs are being used effectively in modern warfare, a different but related avenue for drug usage is economic output. The question I'd like to explore is: do high stimulant drugs spur economic output in cities today?

My initial instincts are that there probably is some correlation between high stimulant drugs and economic output. Cities like Seattle and San Francisco come to mind, cities where you can't walk a block without passing a cafe or coffee stand. Scores of focused workers fill these shops with their laptops and desires for success. Beyond coffee, I've heard stories of sales teams collectively doing cocaine together to stay awake to pound out as many sales calls as they can. Drugs certainly aide in staying awake longer, which will result in working longer, but is doing more work better for economic output?

On the other hand, there is clearly a law of diminishing returns with the usage of high stimulant drugs. In Blitzed, we see that the Nazis accidentally consume too much meth when they attack Britain and consequently lose their first battle of the war. By a similar token, if you've ever consumed coffee for a long period of time, you understand it becomes a daily requirement to just achieve sanity. Thus, I'd suspect when we explore the correlation between high stimulant drug usage, we'll see a bell curve in relation to economic output. With too few drugs or too many drugs, I postulate that economic output is likely to dwindle.

Some other confounding factors that may impact the study that will need to be carefully considered are:
- The cities selected for study. What are the cultural differences that may impact how drugs are used? Are the drugs used for an activity that leads to higher economic output?
- The types of high stimulant drugs used. Are certain high stimulant drugs better than others?
- The population of the cities in question. Any metrics will need to be normalized to a common population size.
- Drug ingress/egress to the city. Are all drugs that enter the city consumed by residents of the city?

It's possible, even likely, that this research question is too broad and will require narrowing. Only research will tell. Some possible further questions:
- What drug most impacts economic output, if any?
